# System_monitor
Goal of this command project that we are given a time limit of 54 hours to write and implement a simple gkrellm tool.\
Were is given instructions to use ncurses to make the monitoring tools as well as provided freedom to add any modules that we find necessary.

Was created two styles of gkrellm, one with a graphic gui(used SFML our gui.) while the other in a basic ncurses.\
Also, final gkrellm has ability to turn off or turn on displaying for each module with push the key. So you can display exactly the monitors that you need at this time.

Here you can see how looks two modes, but unfortunately, this repo doesn't have SFML graphic library to run the code.\
